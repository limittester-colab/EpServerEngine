EpServerEngine repo copied from juhgiyo/EpServerEngine.cs repo - which is only the EpServerEngineSampleClient directory 
orignally used in the multi-client project and essentially the same windows client used in this repo
The windows client runs on windows and acts as another client for the tcp server running on a Raspberry Pi while 
the other clients run on TS-4600 cards.
